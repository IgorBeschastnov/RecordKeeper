App for creating, editing and filling templates for documents and exporting results into .docx

It was my home-project that I've done in June 2017. I stumbled upon it recently and decided to upload it here.
It's a pretty neat app, but back then I was only starting to really get into programming, so it has a lot of clunky code.
Also, I didn't know that sqlite is a thing so all the data is stored in a custom format using java serialization.

I will update this README with screenshots soon.
